  {user_id: 2, question_id: 1, content: "When you declare a reference variable (i.e. an object) you are really creating a pointer to an object. Consider the following code where you declare a variable of primitive type _int_:\n\n```java\nint x;\nx = 10;\n```\n\nIn this example the variable x is an int and Java will initialize it to 0 for you. When you assign it to 10 in the second line your value 10 is written into the memory location pointed to by x.\n\nBut, when you try to declare a reference type something different happens. Take the following code:\n\n```java\nInteger num;\nnum = new Integer(10);\n```\n\nThe first line declares a variable named num, but, it does not contain a primitive value. Instead it contains a pointer (because the type is Integer which is a reference type). Since you did not say as yet what to point to Java sets it to null, meaning \"I am pointing at nothing\".\n\nIn the second line, the new keyword is used to instantiate (or create) an object of type Integer and the pointer variable num is assigned this object. You can now reference the object using the dereferencing operator . (a dot).\n\nThe Exception that you asked about occurs when you declare a variable but did not create an object. If you attempt to dereference num BEFORE creating the object you get a NullPointerException. In the most trivial cases the compiler will catch the problem and let you know that \"num may not have been initialized\" but sometimes you write code that does not directly create the object.\n\nFor instance you may have a method as follows:\n\n```java\npublic void doSomething(SomeObject obj){\n   //do something to obj\n}\n```\n  \nin which case you are not creating the object obj, rather assuming that is was created before the doSomething method was called. Unfortunately it is possible to call the method like this:  \n```java\ndoSomething(null);\n```\n  \n\t\nWhen you declare a reference variable (i.e. an object) you are really creating a pointer to an object.

In this case, you would need to check for a null parameter and behave differently. You should also explain this in the documentation.

  {user_id: 3, question_id: 3, content: "Binary floating point math is like this. In most programming languages, it is based on the IEEE 754 standard. JavaScript uses 64-bit floating point representation, which is the same as Java's double. The crux of the problem is that numbers are represented in this format as a whole number times a power of two; rational numbers (such as 0.1, which is 1/10) whose denominator is not a power of two cannot be exactly represented.\n\nFor 0.1 in the standard binary64 format, the representation can be written exactly as\n\n0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625 in decimal, or\n0x1.999999999999ap-4 in C99 hexfloat notation.\nIn contrast, the rational number 0.1, which is 1/10, can be written exactly as\n\n0.1 in decimal, or\n0x1.99999999999999...p-4 in an analogue of C99 hexfloat notation, where the ... represents an unending sequence of 9's.\nThe constants 0.2 and 0.3 in your program will also be approximations to their true values. It happens that the closest double to 0.2 is larger than the rational number 0.2 but that the closest double to 0.3 is smaller than the rational number 0.3. The sum of 0.1 and 0.2 winds up being larger than the rational number 0.3 and hence disagreeing with the constant in your code.\n\n", reputation: 5, chosen: false, tags: nil},
